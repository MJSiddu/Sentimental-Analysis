# Sentimental-Analysis
##  Supervised Learning Techniques for Sentiment Analytics
We perform sentiment analysis over IMDB movie reviews and Twitter data. Goal is to classify tweets or movie reviews as either positive or negative. We will be using labeled training data to build the model and labeled testing data to evaluate the model. For classification, we experiment with logistic regression as well as a Naive Bayes classifier from python’s well-regarded machine learning package scikit-learn.  

A major part of this project is the task of generating feature vectors for use in these classifiers using two methods: (1) A more traditional NLP technique where the features are simply “important” words and the feature vectors are simple binary vectors and (2) the Doc2Vec technique where document vectors are learned via artificial neural networks.
